# Home-Energy-Monitoring-system
This project can be applied for IoT-based home energy monitoring.

This project can be applied for IoT-based home energy monitoring. The ease of this system can be done through the Blynk application. This project uses Arduino Uno / Nano / Promini and ESP8266 / NodeMCU as data processor and data sender.

Step 1 
The first step is charging the Arduino bootloader using USBasp.

Step 2
The second step is sending a home energy monitoring system using USB to TT. Please click the sample Arduino program and library link below.
